# petersburg-micromobility
<h2>Background:</h2>
<p>Shared Micromobility here refers to single-rider, lightweight vehicles with a 25 mph maximum speed available for rent by the minute.  These are often electric scooters and bicycles operated by a private company permitted to operate by the city.</p>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>his dashboard aims to determine the utility of bringing shared micromobility to Petersburg, with special attention paid to transit riders using micromobility devices to get from their origin to a transit stop or from a transit stop to their destination (first-mile/ last-mile problem). </p>  

<h2>Method:</h2>
<li>Determine likely rider destinations (bus stops, schools, activity centers)</li>
<li>Define polygons of areas from which likely rider destinations are reachable, called isochrones</li>
<li>Analyse isochrone coverage- where in Petersburg are micromobility devices most useful?</li>
<li>Consider demographics- will the groups most likely to benefit from micromobility have access?</li>
